## THIS README IS STILL ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§ DUE TO SEMESTER EXAMS
This is my submission to this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/detect-pneumonia-fall-2020">Kaggle competition</a>. After **85 heroic submissions** full of trial and error, this solution achieved the highest score (86.1%) 

There are 5 pretrained models, 1 Xception and 4 EfficientNets. Each model did its part in the ensemble, on which the final submission was based on.

You can try the code out on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14xSD5mXPMSCAknmjm-bRVU-ohxbtDcXM?usp=sharing">Colab</a>
